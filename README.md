It was fine, nothing crazy, but I would say it is such fun for new comers😎

### Chapter-4 16 SEP 2023 13:28

It was crazy and I have learn fo these minutes so much. I was using standard xpath notation, but i dunno about these cool features

### Chapter-5 16 SEP 2023 13:57

I love it, i did not know about Select and it was interesting🤗

### Chapter-6 16 SEP 2023 14:51

Cool project and because some time passed and elements in amazon changed, it was a little challenge to recreate my own implementation on based knowledge😀

### Chapter-7 16 SEP 2023 15:52
